# MMI 2D-3D Interpolation

This project implements a **Man-Machine Interaction (MMI) software** that facilitates the mapping and visualization of data between 2D schemas and 3D model geometry. The system leverages **interpolation techniques** to seamlessly transform and reproject data, enabling users to work with both 2D and 3D representations simultaneously.

## Features

- **2D-3D Data Mapping**  
  - Designed a robust mechanism for reprojection of data between 2D schemas and 3D models using interpolation techniques.
  - Allows users to map and visualize design elements in both 2D and 3D spaces simultaneously.
  - Rotate, zoom, and manipulate the 3D model for detailed inspection.

- **Structural Design Support**  
  - Tailored for civil engineering applications, enabling efficient manipulation of structural designs in both dimensions.

- **High-Precision Interpolation**  
  - Ensures accurate data transformation to maintain the integrity of designs during reprojecting.

- **Libraries & Tools**: wxWidgets, OpenGL (for rendering), and standard C++ libraries for computation.
